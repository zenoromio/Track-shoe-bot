# Track-shoe-bot
This is a python bot that is able to get sneakers available sizes from a nike.com url

# Selenium or BeautifulSoup
I made two different scripts in order to compare which worked the best.
## Selenium
The Selenium one might be a little slower and required a more complex syntax.
## BeautifulSoup
With bs4 I was able to write a more fluid and faster code. It still uses selenium to open the url.
